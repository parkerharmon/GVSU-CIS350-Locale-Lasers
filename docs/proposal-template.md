# Introduction

In this project, we will be creating a top down 2D rogue-like game. It will be turn-based and the main goal is to progress though stages, leveling up your character, acquiring new gear, and finally reaching the final boss. There will be various monsters to face, skills, and equipment to find. We will most likely use procedural level design in order to create the stages in order to have some randomness as what you'd expect in a rogue-like but to also create scenes with some character.

We plan on tracking the total amount of turns used per run to give the players something to work toward, a lower turn count to beat the game. This will be how we can score runs and also allow players to experiment with different builds and stragies to beat the game as soon as possible. 

# Anticipated Technologies

We plan on using mainly Python as the code base of this game, but will most likely use Unity as well to aid with the game design. Unity will allow us to import free sprite to use as characters to give more visual appeal to the game.

# Method/Approach

These are the main parts of the game we will need to complete:

 - Creating the stages and the various scenes to include in the random generation of the maps.
 - Creating a working character model that can move around on the map.
 - Creating a few monsters, and then working on combat between them and the player character. 
 - Creating the AI for which the monsters will function with.
 - Creating a health system for the characters and monsters.
 - Creating a weapon system and inventory for the character to use.

After these main goals we can work on stretch goals such as:

 - Usable skills that the player can use.
 - Proper balancing within the game.
 - A leveling system for the character.
 - More diverse monsters. 

# Estimated Timeline

Some milestones for this game and rough completion time include:

 - Having the scene and map generation complete - 2 weeks
 - Having a working character - 1 week
 - Having monsters and working AI for them - 1 to 2 weeks
 - Items and Skills created and in the map - 1  week
 - Health and experience system - 1 week
 - Bug testing and stretch goals - 2 weeks or rest of time before due date

# Anticipated Problems

 - Balancing is always be a problem in games and ours will most likely be no exception. So in order to combat this temporarily is to have that turn counter for completion, so that allows players to be rewarded for min-maxing the game.
 - Finding and importing sprites for our character and world.
