# CIS350 Meeting Instructions

Hold a team meeting at least once a week in some format.  Copy the following template below into a new document, naming it GVSU-CIS350-TEAMNAME-YYYY-MM-DD (replacing TEAMNAME with your team's name and the appropriate date fields).  Commit it to this folder, ensuring it is up by each Sunday by 11:59pm.  There should be a unique document for each meeting held.

NOTE:  
These meetings are retroactive as many of our talking points were never in formal meetings. A lot of it was just done over discord texting and talking at random points in person. We didn't really have many formal meetings, so I added these roughly in line with when we actually talking about the following topics within each meeting doc.
